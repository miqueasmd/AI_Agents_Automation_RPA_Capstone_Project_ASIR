# AI Agents & Automation: Complement or Competition for IT Ops? ðŸš€
> A capstone research project that investigates whether AI assistants and RPA platforms **augment** or **threaten** the daily work of System & Network Administration (ASIR) professionals.

## Overview
The exponential rise of AI agents (e.g., GitHub Copilot, Cursor) and Robotic Process Automation tools (UiPath, Automation Anywhere, Power Automate) is reshaping IT operations.  
This project delivers a theory-driven analysis that helps current and future ASIR technicians understand if these technologies become invaluable teammates or direct rivals.

## Key Objectives
- **Assess the landscape** â€“ review recent advances in AI agents, enterprise RPA and low-code/no-code integration platforms.  
- **Classify & benchmark tools** â€“ compare three categories: AI assistants, RPA suites and integration workflows (Make, Zapier, n8n).  
- **Measure the impact on roles** â€“ examine how automation influences core ASIR tasks, efficiency, cost and required competencies.  
- **Map skills & training needs** â€“ identify the up-skilling paths that keep technicians relevant in an AI-augmented environment.

## Tech Stack & Methodology
| Category | Tools / Resources |
|----------|------------------|
| **AI Assistants** | GitHub Copilot, Cursor |
| **RPA Suites** | UiPath, Automation Anywhere, Power Automate |
| **Integration / LCNC** | Make, Zapier, n8n |
| **Authoring & Media** | MS Word, Google Docs, Gamma App, OBS Studio |
| **Research Method** | State-of-the-Art review â†’ comparative analysis â†’ conceptual design |

## Highlights â€“ What Youâ€™ll Learn
- Quantified productivity boosts vs. potential job displacement.
- Risk & cybersecurity considerations when deploying bots.
- A modular reference architecture for hybrid human-bot workflows.
- A skills roadmap for ASIR technicians in 2025 and beyond.
